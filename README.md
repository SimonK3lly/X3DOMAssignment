# X3DOM House Scene

This project is a college assignment demonstrating the use of X3DOM to create a 3D scene of a house with various elements.

## Description

This project showcases a 3D scene built using X3DOM, an open-source framework for 3D graphics on the web. The scene includes:

- A house structure
- A car model with animated wheels
- Mountain backdrop
- Hedges and pillars
- Ground texture
- Sky background
- Interactive camera movement

## Features

- Interactive 3D scene viewable in web browsers
- Custom viewpoint for optimal scene viewing
- Textured surfaces using image textures
- Complex 3D models (car, mountain, hedge) integrated into the scene
- Lighting effects to enhance visual appeal
- Keyboard controls for camera movement
- Animated car wheels
- Camera transition effects

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- X3DOM
- JavaScript
- CSS

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main file containing the X3DOM scene
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling
- `main.js`: JavaScript file for additional functionality
- `textures/`: Directory containing texture images and 3D model files
  - `car.x3d`: 3D model file for the car
  - `mountain.x3d`: 3D model file for the mountain backdrop
  - `Hedge.x3d`: 3D model file for the hedges
  - Various texture image files (e.g., `brickTexture.jpeg`, `concrete.jpeg`, `sky.jpg`)

## Usage

To view the 3D scene:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser that supports WebGL.
3. Use arrow keys to navigate the camera:
   - Up/Down: Move forward/backward
   - Left/Right: Rotate the camera

### Scene Setup
The main structure of the 3D scene is defined in the index.html file:
